# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to see the issue

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npx start-storybook`
Observe the app renders in the browser almost instantly after you see the Storybook 6.2.9 Started message in the command line

### `Edit the file Button.tsx to uncomment line 51 and repeat`
Observe the app renders in the browser but now takes several seconds after you see the Storybook 6.2.9 Started message in the command line

### `Edit the file Button.tsx to comment line 51 then uncomment line 52 and repeat`
Observe the app renders in the browser almost instantly after you see the Storybook 6.2.9 Started message in the command line
